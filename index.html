        <p>
          Hi! My name is <strong>Jose Riera Tur</strong> and I welcome you to my
          <strong>portfolio</strong>!
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I show all the <strong>projects</strong> that I made and
          explain the steps that I followed for each one<!--since the
          beginning of the journey as a <strong>web developer</strong>
          <!--until I got to comprehend all its different areas-->.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also include the <strong>courses</strong> that I completed, together
          with the <strong>websites</strong> that I created to put every
          <strong>technology</strong> into practice.
        </p>

      <section class="the-beginning-section section">
        <h2>before the beginning...</h2>
        <p>
          Before I started this <strong>passion</strong>, I was already
          skilled in different areas (because of my education, career and hobbies)
          that have been of huge help during the journey:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Game <strong>development</strong></li>
          <li>Graphic <strong>design</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Mathematics</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Languages</strong></li>
          <li>Good formal-writting <strong>practices</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Microsoft Office</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And of course, the <strong>soft skills</strong> that got me this far
          without not giving up while being self-taught:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Patience</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Creativity</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Self-motivation</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Constancy</strong></li>
          <li>Time <strong>management</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Fun</strong> (you will find very soon why)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>let's go!...</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/"
            target="_blank"
            >This</a
          >
          is the course that I made, and <a href="#" target="_blank">this</a> is
          the website that I did just afterwards.
        </p>
        <!--<p>
          My goal with this website was putting into practice everything I learned so
          far, while trying to get help only from the notes I took during the
          course, so I could be sure they were well organized in case I needed
          them in the future.-->
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from making use of the most common tools like
          <strong>flexbox</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>
          grid, I also:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Designed</strong> the logo with Affinity Designer.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adapted</strong> each image to be only double of the maximum
            size.
          </li>
          <li>Made the website <strong>responsive.</strong></li>
          <li>
            <strong>Edited</strong> each picture to have a lighter or darker
            background to be more clearer.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Created</strong> all the content (images and texts).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I also made <a href="#" target="_blank">this</a>
           website along with the course (content and instructions were provided).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Step 2: GIT and GITHub</h3>
        <p>
          Being aware that I will be joining a <strong>team</strong>
          in the future together with the importance of the use of a VCS,
          I completed
          <a href="#" target="_blank">this</a> course before doing anything else.
          Then I did <a href="#" target="_blank">this</a>
          website to put into practice all the console commands I learned while having a remembrance of HTML/CSS.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3: JavaScript</h3>
