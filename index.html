        <p>
          Hi! My name is <strong>Jose Riera Tur</strong> and I welcome you to my
          <strong>portfolio</strong>!
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I show all the <strong>projects</strong> that I made so far and
          explain the steps that I followed for each one<!--since the
          beginning of the journey as a <strong>web developer</strong>
          <!--until I got to comprehend all its different areas-->.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also include the <strong>courses</strong> that I completed, together
          with the <strong>websites</strong> that I created to put every
          <strong>technology</strong> into practice.
        </p>
        <p> This will also serve as a <strong>guideline</strong>
          for newcomers who are willing to start this amazing journey but don't know how.
           This <strong>methodology</strong> is a result of long research and good advice from professionals.</p>

        <h2>before the beginning...</h2>
        <p>
          Before I started this <strong>passion</strong>, I was already
          skilled in different areas (because of my education, career and hobbies)
          that have been of huge help during the journey. The most significant ones have been:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Game <strong>development</strong> (Unity and Godot engines and some basic C#)</li>
          <li>Graphic <strong>design</strong> (Affinity Designer. I love it!)</li>
          <li><strong>Mathematics</strong> (They never left me: first at school; then as an audio technician)</li>
          <li><strong>Languages</strong> (I cannot imagine the learning curve without knowing EN or DE)</li>
          <li>Good formal-writting <strong>practices</strong> (I wrote thousands of formal letters at my last job)</li>
          <li><strong>Microsoft Office</strong> (It was also very used at my last job)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And of course, the <strong>soft skills</strong> that got me this far
          without not giving up while being self-taught:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Patience</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Creativity</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Self-motivation</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Constancy</strong></li>
          <li>Time <strong>management</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Fun</strong> (you will find why very soon)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>let's go!...</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/"
            target="_blank"
            >This</a
          >
          is the course that I made, and <a href="#" target="_blank">this</a> is
          the website that I did just afterwards.
        </p>
        <!--<p>
          My goal with this website was putting into practice everything I learned so
          far, while trying to get help only from the notes I took during the
          course, so I could be sure they were well organized in case I needed
          them in the future.-->
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from making use of the most common tools like
          <strong>flexbox</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>
          grid, I also:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Designed</strong> the logo with Affinity Designer.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adapted</strong> each image to be only double of the maximum
            size.
          </li>
          <li>Made the website <strong>responsive.</strong></li>
          <li>
            <strong>Edited</strong> each picture to have a lighter or darker
            background to be more clearer.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Created</strong> all the content (images and texts).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I also made <a href="#" target="_blank">this</a>
           website along with the course (content and instructions were provided though).
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2: GIT and GITHub</h3>
        <p>
          Being aware that I will be joining a <strong>team</strong>
          in the future together with the importance of the use of a VCS,
          I completed <a href="#" target="_blank">this</a> course before doing anything else.
        </p>
        <p>I also created the first repo of this folder and uploaded it (at this point in time)
          to GitHub to start practicing the main functions.</p>
        <p class="personal-input"><!--<strong id="personal-input-intro">Some personal input:--></strong> GIT is the most amazing technology I learned so far.
          Somehow HTML and CSS felt like an adaptation of what I already knew about
          Microsoft Office and Affinity Designer, into code.
          I cannot believe what GIT does. If I knew about it before...
          <!-- (thinking now about all the times in my life that I created a copy (and a copy of a copy) of a file to create different branches). -->
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>

            <h3>Step 3: JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
              Having a long <a href="#" target="_blank">course</a> ahead (67 hours in total), I decided to start using <a href="#" target="_blank">Codewars</a>
              after learning the basics of JavaScript language. And... I got <strong>addicted!</strong> 100% recommended.
              Just check my profile to see all the katas that I completed. It really helps to remember most JavaScript concepts.
            </p>
            <p class="personal-input"><!--<strong id="personal-input-intro">Some personal input:--></strong> 
              While being in the middle of the course, I took the decision to start a real project
              since I have the feeling that I am getting too far away from the main goal, which is being able to do websites.
              Also the amount of knowledge accumulated but yet not applied is huge.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 4: First real project</h3>
            <p>
              But what should I do? I look around and I see two white boards full of skteches, 12 written pieces of paper on the wall,
              a giant bookshelf with tens of started notebooks, an electronic drumset with post-its everywhere...
              What do all these notes have in common?
              <p><strong>The will for progress!</strong></p>
            </p>
            <p> So I decided to create a kind of a 'life/habits/goals manager/tracker/guide'.
              Actually I will apply my method and have it on a website so it is more effective and easy to use. And by doing this I will also save tons of ink!
              There is no will for profits nor outer success but maybe it can help other people.
            </p>
            <p>Motivation? Check! Name of the project?</p>
            <!-- <p>
              The name?</p> -->
            <p><strong>moremore.me!</strong></p>
            <!-- <p>
              After having started  <a href="#" target="_blank">this</a> course, I got stuck.
              Oh oh... Will it be a good idea to learn React without having done a real project already with only vanilla JavaScript?
              The amount of not-yet-applied-JS-knowledge-to-a-web is extreme and I am having the feeling that if I start now with React, some JS features will not stick.
            </p> -->
