18/08/2023: I didn't know github activity was so important... It seems that those green squares work like magic to recruiters eyes, which makes sense if those are related to work. The truth is that, one the one hand, when I started, I didn't use GIT much. One the second hand, I thought it was more important having one big project than showing smaller things that can be masked by the skilles showed in other projects, but it seems that that's not the case (got a very valuable feedback today from a recruiter about this). So here we are.
